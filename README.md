<h1>Problem description </h1>

Spot-checking is a way of discovering which algorithms perform well on your machine learning problem.

You cannot know which algorithms are best suited to your problem before hand. You must trial a number of methods and focus attention on those that prove themselves the most promising.

In this repository you will discover 6 machine learning algorithms that you can use when spot checking your classification problem in Python with scikit-learn.

Letâ€™s get started.

What algorithm should I use on my dataset?
